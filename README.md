# RPiDeskLight
Repository composed of two python programs I wrote in order to make an intelligent desk backlighting system controlled by a RaspberryPi3.
The desk-backlight python program runs on the RPi whereas the screenGrab python program runs on your personal windows computer.

In order for this to work your RPi and Windows PC have to be connected to the same network (which is how information is passed from the desktop machine to the RPi).
